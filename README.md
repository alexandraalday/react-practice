## Component Lifecycle

These methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.

   - `componentDidMount`, for example, is called immediately after a component is rendered to the DOM.

   - `componentWillUnmount` is called immediately before a component is removed from the DOM.

Some common uses of lifecycle methods are making asynchronous requests, binding event listeners, and optimizing for performance.

React components' life cycle events fall into three broad categories:

   - `Initializing/mounting` (These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM)

   - `Updating` (An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called when a component is being re-rendered)

   - `Destruction/unmounting` (This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM)

You don't need to write these methods.

   - They happen automatically, just like constructors did before we explicitly wrote one.

   - You only have to worry about these if you want to change something in them


### Initializing/mounting Methods

Methods include:

   - `constructor()`
        This is sometimes referred to as a combination of `getInitialState()` and `getDefaultProps()`.

   - `componentWillMount()`

   - `componentDidMount()`

   - `render()`

### Updating Methods

Methods include:

   - `componentWillReceiveProps()`

   - `shouldComponentUpdate()`

   - `componentWillUpdate()`

   - `componentDidUpdate()`

   - `render()`
   
 ### Destruction/unmounting

 The method is:
     
   - `componentWillUnmount()`

## The constructor() method

This is in the first part of the component lifecycle - `initializing/mounting`.

Like any JavaScript class, the constructor method:

   - Is called when a component is instantiated (when it's first rendered).

   - In a class constructor, you must call super before doing anything else. A React component constructor in its most basic form looks like this:

```
constructor(props) {
  super(props)
}
```
You don't need to define a constructor if that's all it does, however.

   - This happens automatically when your component is invoked.
   - A common use of the constructor is to initialize state using the props passed to the component â€” as we have been doing!

```
constructor(props) {
  super(props)
  this.state = {
    someproperty: props.someproperty
  }
}
```

Notice that in this constructor, `this.addStuff` is bound to the class here: `this.addStuff = this.addStuff.bind(this)`.

Now, if we pass `this.addStuff` to a child component as an `onChange` callback, it will be bound to `StuffTable` and will update its state when it's invoked.

You don't need a constructor in every React component, but if you need to initialize `state` by `props` or `bind` methods, the constructor is where you do it.

```
class StuffTable extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      stuff: props.stuff
    }
    this.addStuff = this.addStuff.bind(this)
  }

  addStuff(newStuff) {
   this.setState(prevState => ({
      stuff: prevState.stuff.concat(newStuff)
    }))
  }

}
```

## The componentWillMount() Method

This is in the first part of the component lifecycle - `initializing/mounting`. This method is called immediately before a component is rendered to the DOM.

`componentWillMount` is usually only needed in advanced use cases such as server rendering.
---

## The componentDidMount() Method

The `componentDidMount` method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. It is in the first part of the component lifecycle - `initializing/mounting`.

If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, do it here (not in the constructor or in `componentWillMount`).

- `componentWillMount` shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before the render in future versions of React.

```
componentDidMount() {
  fetch(`http://api.com/${this.props.id}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => this.setState(prevState => ({ data })))
}
```
